# reproduction-work

This repository is a collection of work I have done to help me learn new techniques and new concepts while studying polymer science.

`FH-theory-work.ipynb` focuses on the fundamental Flory-Huggins theory describing the thermodynamics of polymer solutions and blends.

`PECC-dipolar-interactions.ipynb` focuses on the effect of electrostatic dipolar interactions on polyelectrolyte complex coacervation.
